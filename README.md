## Why Pick This Project?

1. **Deliverables on Steroids**  
   Not only did I tick off all the required tasks and bonus sections (hello, Docker), but I also threw in a fully loaded Docusaurus documentation site, set up Telegram notifications for repo push events, and even deployed it to a real server—because why stop at just *good enough*?

2. **A Tech Stack Built to Impress**  
   With Grafana, cAdvisor, and Prometheus holding down the fort, this project is ready for the big leagues. It’s tailor-made for monitoring blockchain infrastructure (Ethereum, I see you), ensuring everything is running smoothly in real time. It's the kind of stack that whispers "enterprise-approved" without even trying.

3. **Corporate-Level Code—Or So I Hope**  
   Written entirely in TypeScript (because who doesn’t love type safety?), the code comes packed with a custom logger and error handling that would make any CTO nod approvingly. Let’s just say, I’m aiming for *clean, professional*, with a side of "hey, this could actually run in production."
