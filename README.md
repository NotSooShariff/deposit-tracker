## 🔥 Why Pick This Project?

1. **Deliverables on Steroids**  
   I didn’t just complete the tasks—I went above and beyond! From bonus sections (hello, Docker 🐳) to a fully loaded Docusaurus documentation site, I also set up Telegram notifications for repo push events 📬 and deployed everything to a live server. No half-measures here!

2. **A Tech Stack Built to Impress**  
   With Grafana 📊, cAdvisor 🖥️, and Prometheus 🔍, this project is enterprise-ready. Designed for real-time monitoring of blockchain infrastructure (Ethereum included ⛓️), it’s built for smooth, hassle-free operation. 

3. **Corporate-Level Code—Or So I Hope**  
   Written in TypeScript (because type safety 💪), the code includes a custom logger and robust error handling. The goal: clean, professional, and production-ready from the get-go.
